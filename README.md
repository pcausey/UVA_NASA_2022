# UVA_NASA_2021

Repository for the UVA Master's in Data Science capstone project in collaboration with NASA. The goal of this project is to create tools that will retrieve, process, plot, and interpret satellite data in order to provide ground level air quality products. 

The data is retrieved via FTP (account required) from archives hosted on https://www.icare.univ-lille.fr/. 

Our project focuses on lidar data from the CALIPSO satellite as well as polarimetry data from PARASOL missions.
